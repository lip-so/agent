# LeRobot Installer Dependencies

# The desktop installer (robot_installer.py) uses only built-in Python libraries:
# - tkinter (GUI framework)
# - threading (for responsive UI)
# - subprocess (for running commands)
# - os, sys, shutil, pathlib (file operations)
# - time (timestamps and delays)

# No additional pip packages are required for the installer to run!
# The installer will handle all LeRobot dependencies automatically.

# Optional: If you want to package as a standalone executable
# pyinstaller>=5.0
